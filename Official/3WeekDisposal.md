#3 Week Disposal

Items found in the space that aren't known Build Brighton assets and items without a Do Not Hack label on should be placed into the week 1 disposal box.
You should also post a description or a photo to the mailing list.

The contents of each box will be shifted right at the end of the week, i.e. week 1 to week 2 and week 2 to week 3

Items being moved out of the week 3 box should be placed into bin if they are small enough or under the table if they need to go to the tip.

Members shouldn't take items from the week 1 and week 2 boxes that don't belong to them, this is so the owner has time to reclaim the property.


This system gives anyone who has left anything behind several weeks to reclaim it before it is disposed of.
